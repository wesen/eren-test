# ggplot2 Visualization for Gene Expression Comparison

## Overview

This ticket documents ggplot2 visualization approaches for comparing two log fold change gene expression datasets, with emphasis on distinguishing significant from insignificant data points. The reference document provides copy/paste-ready code examples for scatter plots, MA plots, and volcano plots commonly used in gene expression analysis.

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive reference guide for researchers visualizing gene expression comparisons using R and ggplot2.
